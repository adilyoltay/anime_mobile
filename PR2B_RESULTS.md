# PR2b Results - ID Remap Fallback Fix

## Date: October 1, 2024, 12:18 PM

## Implementation: ✅ COMPLETE

### Changes Made

**File**: `converter/src/serializer.cpp`

**Both functions updated**:
1. `serialize_minimal_riv` (lines 287-337)
2. `serialize_core_document` (lines 485-531)

**Fix Applied**:
- When ID remap fails for properties 51/92/272 (KeyedObject::objectId, ClippingShape::sourceId, TextValueRun::styleId)
- **OLD behavior**: Fall through to `writeProperty()` → writes RAW global ID
- **NEW behavior**: Skip property entirely (`continue`) → prevents out-of-range index errors

**Diagnostic Logging**:
- First 10 remap misses per key logged with: `⚠️  PR2b remap-miss: key=X globalId=Y — skipping property`
- Summary printed at end of first artboard

## Test Results

### ✅ Simple Rectangle: SUCCESS
- File: `output/pr2b_simple_rect.riv` (213 bytes)
- Import: SUCCESS
- No remap misses

### ❌ Bee_baby 190 objects: MALFORMED (unchanged)
- File: `output/pr2b_bee_190.riv` (5306 bytes)
- Import: FAILED - Malformed file
- **No remap misses detected** → Fix applied but issue persists

### ❌ Bee_baby Full (273 objects): FREEZE (unchanged)
- File: `output/pr2b_bee_full.riv` (6321 bytes)
- Import: FREEZE (infinite loop)
- **No remap misses detected** → Fix applied but issue persists

## Analysis

### Key Finding: No Remap Misses!

The PR2b fix was correctly applied, but **zero remap misses were detected** in any test. This means:

1. **ID remap is NOT the root cause** - All component references (51/92/272) successfully found their mappings
2. The freeze/malformed issue has a different origin

### Remaining Hypothesis

Since remap is working correctly, the issue must be:

**Option A: Input JSON Structure Issue**
- `bee_baby_extracted.json` may have structural problems from hierarchical extractor
- Missing required properties
- Invalid parent relationships
- Circular references

**Option B: Runtime Threshold Bug**
- Runtime has object count limit or complexity threshold
- Works up to 189 objects
- Fails at 190+ (possibly buffer overflow, stack depth, or similar)

**Option C: Specific Object Type Issue**
- Object 190 (Shape with Ellipse child) triggers runtime bug
- Not about the object itself, but combination with previous 189 objects
- Possible accumulated state causing issue

### Object 190 Details
```
190: typeKey=3 (Shape)
     localId=190
     parentId=10 (Node - exists in first 190 objects)
191: typeKey=4 (Ellipse)
     localId=191
     parentId=190 (the Shape above)
```

Nothing obviously wrong with these objects.

### Forward References Found
```
188: SolidColor, parentId=234 (doesn't exist in 190-object subset)
189: TrimPath, parentId=234 (doesn't exist in 190-object subset)
```

But these forward references exist in 189-object test which SUCCEEDS, so they're not the issue.

## Next Steps

### Recommended: Test with Different Source

1. **Extract from original bee_baby.riv using universal_extractor**
   - Verify extracted JSON is valid
   - Compare with current `bee_baby_extracted.json`

2. **Test with simpler complex file**
   - Find/create a file with 200+ objects that works
   - Isolate if issue is bee_baby-specific or universal

3. **Runtime Debugging**
   - Attach debugger to import_test
   - Set breakpoint in Rive runtime
   - Identify exact location of freeze/malformed error

### Alternative: Incremental Object Analysis

Create test files adding objects one by one from 189 to 195:
```bash
for i in 189 190 191 192 193 194 195; do
  # Create JSON with exactly i objects
  # Convert and test
  # Log which object causes first failure
done
```

## Conclusion

**PR2b Fix Status**: ✅ Implemented correctly, but not the root cause

**Root Cause**: Still unknown, but eliminated:
- ✅ NOT keyed animation data (PR2)
- ✅ NOT StateMachine objects (PR2.3)
- ✅ NOT ID remap failures (PR2b)

**Remaining suspects**:
1. Input JSON quality/structure
2. Runtime object count threshold
3. Specific object combination triggering runtime bug

**Recommendation**: Before proceeding further with converter fixes, verify the input JSON is valid by:
1. Re-extracting from original .riv file
2. Testing with known-good complex files
3. Or debugging runtime to find exact failure point

The issue may be in the **Rive runtime importer** rather than our converter.
