### Key Findings

#### 1. Freeze is NOT Caused by Keyed Data ❌
- **OMIT_KEYED=true**: All keyed animation data (KeyedObject, KeyedProperty, KeyFrames, Interpolators) completely skipped
- **Result**: Freeze still occurs with full bee_baby file
- **Conclusion**: Keyed data is NOT the root cause

#### 2. Freeze is NOT Caused by StateMachine ❌
- **OMIT_STATE_MACHINE=true**: All SM objects (53/56/57/58/59/61/62/63/64/65) completely skipped
- **Result**: Freeze still occurs with full bee_baby file
- **Conclusion**: StateMachine is NOT the root cause

#### 3. Freeze is Object-Count Dependent ✅
- **189 objects**: SUCCESS (import completes, no freeze)
- **190 objects**: MALFORMED (runtime rejects file)
- **273 objects**: FREEZE (infinite loop in runtime)

#### 4. Object 190 Analysis
```
Object 190 (index 189):
  typeKey: 47 (TrimPath)
  localId: 189
  parentId: 234 (does not exist in 190-object subset)
  properties: {} (empty)
```

**Note**: Skipping TrimPath does NOT resolve freeze with full file (272 objects still freeze)

#### 5. Missing Parent Warnings
- 189 objects: 30 missing parents → SUCCESS
- 190 objects: 31 missing parents → MALFORMED
- 273 objects: 37 missing parents → FREEZE

**Pattern**: Missing parents alone don't cause freeze (189 works with 30 missing). Something else triggers at higher object counts.

### Root Cause Hypothesis

The freeze appears to be caused by:
1. **NOT keyed animation data** (eliminated via OMIT_KEYED)
2. **NOT StateMachine objects** (eliminated via OMIT_STATE_MACHINE)
3. **Object count or complexity threshold** (works up to 189, fails at 190+)
4. **Possibly**: 
   - Circular parent reference in objects 190-273
   - Invalid object hierarchy causing infinite traversal
   - Runtime bug triggered by specific object combination
   - Memory/buffer overflow at certain object count

### Diagnostic Logs

**Keyed Data (from full bee_baby)**:
```
=== PR2 KEYED DATA DIAGNOSTICS ===
OMIT_KEYED flag: ENABLED (keyed data skipped)
LinearAnimation count: 0
StateMachine count: 0

Keyed types in JSON:
  typeKey 28: 8 (CubicEaseInterpolator)
  typeKey 138: 26 (CubicValueInterpolator)
Total keyed in JSON: 34
Keyed types created: 0 (all skipped by OMIT_KEYED)
=================================
```

**Parent Relationships (full bee_baby)**:
```
PASS 2: Setting parent relationships for 238 objects...
✅ Set 237 parent relationships
```

**No Cascade Skip Warnings**: All KeyedObject.objectId references resolved successfully

### Next Steps

#### Option A: Deep Dive into Objects 190-273
1. Identify which specific object(s) in range 190-273 cause the issue
2. Binary search to find exact problematic object
3. Analyze that object's structure and relationships
4. Check for circular references or invalid hierarchy

#### Option B: Runtime Debugging
1. Attach debugger to import_test
2. Set breakpoint in Rive runtime's object traversal code
3. Identify where infinite loop occurs
4. Determine which object or relationship causes loop

#### Option C: Incremental Object Addition
1. Start with 189 objects (working)
2. Add objects one by one from 190-273
3. Test after each addition
4. Identify first object that causes failure

### Conclusion

**PR2 Successfully Eliminated Two Hypotheses**:
1. ✅ Keyed animation data is NOT the cause
2. ✅ StateMachine objects are NOT the cause

**PR2 Identified New Problem Domain**:
- Issue is in the **core object hierarchy** (shapes, paths, paints, transforms)
- Triggered at specific object count/complexity threshold (≥190 objects)
- Likely involves object traversal or parent-child relationships
- May be a runtime bug rather than converter bug

**Recommendation**: 
- **DO NOT proceed to PR3** (keyed data emission) yet
- **FIRST** resolve the core object hierarchy issue (objects 190-273)
- Use Option C (incremental addition) to isolate exact problematic object
- Consider filing bug report with Rive team if runtime issue confirmed

### Code Changes Made

**File**: `converter/src/universal_builder.cpp`

1. Added `OMIT_KEYED` flag (line 446)
2. Added `OMIT_STATE_MACHINE` flag (line 447)
3. Added TrimPath skip for debugging (lines 597-604)
4. Enhanced diagnostic logging (lines 830-866)
5. Fixed name property key semantics (lines 141-152)
6. Updated typeMap with keys 55 and 138 (lines 422, 429)

All changes are temporary debugging flags and can be removed once root cause is found.
